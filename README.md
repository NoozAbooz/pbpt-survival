This repo is used to store backups from various points throughout the history of the PBPT MCPI survival server.

PBPT is a 2b2t-like semi-anarchy server with a twist, it's meant for Minecraft Pi Edition, a 2013 MCPE 0.6.1 fork made for the Raspberry Pi. To join it, you must install [MCPI-Reborn](https://github.com/mcpi-revival/minecraft-pi-reborn) or [MCPI++](https://github.com/mobilegmYT/mcpi-reborn-extended), the first of which you can install from [pi-apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps).

To use the world downloads, just extract a backup and copy the `games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/world/` folder to `~/.minecraft-pi/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/` (optionally rename the folder). Then just boot up MCPI and load the world! For season one backups, you'll need to copy `mcpi-survival-server/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/world/` instead.

Every new season started on or a day after the last one ended

Season 1 lasted from Jan 14, 2021 and ended on June 25, 2021. It ended as the world was too griefed with OP items and it was too filled with builds.

Season 2 lasted from June 26 to July 7. It used a amplified mountains biome seed to experiment around with how players and griefers adapted to everything being hard to reach due to the extreme height changes in different areas.  
- It uses seed `-1965077007`
- And ended due to too much grief in the spawn area and not being fun to play in

Season 3 started July 7. It went back to a flat world seed with spawn being on a island. 

Season 4 started July 30th

Season 5 started September 15

Season 6 started Novenber 6 on the world seed from the season 1 map. It started with the ban of the infamous MCPI server griefer "StevePi", in attempts to curb mass griefs and specifically the insane lag at spawn from the prior. 

Season 7 started [TBD] and had the notable addition of a antigrief, to stop the mass griefing which caused lag to the server.
