This repo is used to store backups from various points throughout the history of the PBPT MCPI survival server.

PBPT is a 2b2t-like semi-anarchy server with a twist, it's meant for Minecraft Pi Edition, a 2013 MCPE 0.6.1 fork made for the Raspberry Pi. To join it, you must install [MCPI-Reborn](https://github.com/mcpi-revival/minecraft-pi-reborn) or [MCPI++](https://github.com/mobilegmYT/mcpi-reborn-extended), the former of which which you can install from [pi-apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps).

To use the world downloads, just extract a backup and copy the `games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/world/` folder to `~/.minecraft-pi/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/` (optionally rename the folder). Then just boot up MCPI and load the world! For season one backups, you'll need to copy `mcpi-survival-server/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/world/` instead.

Every new season started on or a day after the last one ended

Season 1 lasted from Jan 14, 2021 and ended on June 25, 2021. It ended as the world was too griefed with OP items (such as illegally stacked items, invisible bedrock, and lava tiles) and it was too filled with builds.

Notable builds:
- Blue Rank Business Corp
  - Description: "A one-stop-shop for everything MCPI!"
  - Owner: Unknown
- Sandstone store (unofficial)
  - Description: A shop made out of sandstone that sells beds and has a flag made of grass
  - Owner: Jimmymouse4312
- NikZapps Windmill
  - Description: Possiblely the most recognizable build in S1, it has a messaging board that was pretty active
  - Owner: NikZapp
- Obsidian bunker (unofficial)
  - Description: A huge obsidian bunker with 8 bedrooms.
  - Owner: Unknown
- House on a hill (unofficial)
  - Description: A three room house on a hill with a hidden chest full of OP items.
  - Owner: Unknown

Season 2 lasted from June 26 to July 7. It used a amplified mountains biome seed to experiment around with how players and griefers adapted to everything being hard to reach due to the extreme height changes in different areas.  
- It uses seed `-1965077007`
- And ended due to too much grief in the spawn area and not being fun to play in

Season 3 started July 7. It went back to a flat world seed with spawn being on a island. 

Season 4 started July 30th. 

Season 5 started September 15

Season 6 started Novenber 6 on the world seed from the season 1 map. It started with the ban of the infamous MCPI server griefer "StevePi", in attempts to curb mass griefs and specifically the insane lag at spawn from the prior. The server changed from PBPT-Anarchy to PBPT-Survival. A whitelist had to be added for a short amount of time. 

Season 7 started March 27 and had the notable addition of a anti-grief (in the form of an anti-TNT mod and anti-nether reactor mod), to stop the mass griefing which caused lag to the server.
