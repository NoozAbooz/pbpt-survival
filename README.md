Season 1 lasted from Jan 14, 2021 and ended on June 25, 2021. It ended as the world was too griefed with OP items and it was too filled with builds.

Season 2 lasted from June 26 to July 7. It used a amplified mountains biome seed to experiment around with how players and griefers adapted to everything being hard to reach due to the extreme height changes in different areas.  
- It uses seed `-1965077007`
- And ended due to too much grief in the spawn area and not being fun to play in

Season 3 started July 7. It went back to a flat world seed with spawn being on a island.
